# Gas_Price_Analysis

This app is an analysis of publicly available Canadian gas price data from [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810000101). 
Also included is city population data which was extracted from [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/population_and_demography) . The interactive animated plots
were created using the [Plotly API](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/). The data ranges from January 1990 to March 2022, future plans include perhaps creating a pipeline that updates the dataset to keep the web app up to date. Perhaps maybe even adding in a forecasting feature....

This project served as an exercise for me to explore different ways of analyzing time series data as well as figuring out plotly and streamlit.
